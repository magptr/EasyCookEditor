# EasyCookEditor
EasyCookEditor is a Unreal Editor plugin designed to make asset cooking for Unreal Engine 4 easier, primarily for modding purposes, with a focus on cooked asset projects.
This is the editor version of the Python based GUI, it's got improved folder handling, duplicate catching and is much faster and generally better in every way lol.

# Why bother?
Traditionally, cooking assets in Unreal relies on placing the assets you want cooked into maps, then specifying that map in the cooking process, this often results in unnecessary cooking of additional shaders, assets, and other content you donâ€™t actually need. This wastes both time and resources.

**EasyCook Editor** solves this by letting you specify exactly which assets or folders to cook. You can:
* Select only what you need using the content browser in editor to cook nothing extra.
* Speed up your workflow and focus on modding, not setup.

# Installation
* **Prebuilt**: A prebuilt plugin is available in Releases
* You can build it yourself using the source if you want to make further modifications, I will not make a guide on how to build, all source included builds perfectly fine.
